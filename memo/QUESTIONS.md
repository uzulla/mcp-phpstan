# Questions and TODOs for MCP PHPStan Integration

## Implementation Questions

1. **Claude API Integration**
   - What specific Claude API endpoint should be used for MCP integration?
   - Are there any specific requirements for the message format when using MCP with Claude?
   - What authentication method should be used for Claude API access?

2. **Error Fix Application**
   - How should the fixes suggested by Claude be applied to the PHP files?
   - Should we implement a backup mechanism before applying fixes?
   - Should we implement a way to review fixes before applying them?

3. **Incremental Processing**
   - What is the optimal batch size for error processing?
   - Should we prioritize certain types of errors over others?
   - How should we handle errors that Claude cannot fix?

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Interface**
   - Would a web interface or GUI be beneficial for this tool?
   - Should we implement a progress visualization for the incremental processing?

2. **Integration with IDEs**
   - Should we consider integrating with popular PHP IDEs like PhpStorm?
   - How would this integration work?

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Can we parallelize the processing of error batches?
   - How can we optimize the file reading/writing operations?

## Technical TODOs

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement more robust error handling throughout the codebase
   - Add logging for better debugging

2. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Set up CI/CD for automated testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Add more examples to the documentation
   - Create a troubleshooting guide

4. **Code Quality**
   - Add type hints to all functions and methods
   - Implement code linting and formatting

## Integration with Other Tools

1. **Other Static Analysis Tools**
   - Should we consider supporting other PHP static analysis tools like Psalm or Phan?
   - How would the architecture need to change to support multiple tools?

2. **Other LLMs**
   - Should we consider supporting other LLMs besides Claude?
   - What changes would be needed to support multiple LLMs?
